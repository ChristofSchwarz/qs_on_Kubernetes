 ## the idea
This minimalistic NodeJS app creates a signed JWT token which can work as Bearer Authentication in Qlik Sense Enterprise on Kubernetes. It allows you to impersonate as the user you want and to automate API calls that otherwise are not possible. Handle with caution.
This tool runs in two different modes
 - locally (you will need nodejs and npm installed)
 - as Kubernetes Pod (you need to have kubectl access to your Kubernetes cluster)
To get started download this entire folder (get the whole git and use folder “jwtcreate”)
## Create public and private SSH key pair
If you want to skip this step for a quick test, you may use the attached priv.key and pub.key although this compromises your security!
Any SSH key pair would work. To create a new one (under Linux) execute these commands
```
openssl genrsa -out priv.key 4096
openssl rsa -in priv.key -pubout -out pub.key
```
## run locally
* 
## run in Kubernetes
